# Eclipse

## Overview

Eclipse is a popular IDE for developing multiple types of languages, including Java. 

## eclipse.ini File

One of the most common changes I find myself making to Eclipse is the .ini file found in the root folder of the project. As of more recent versions, the JVM memory settings have been modernized and tend to be sufficient for development. I will find myself changing the -vm option to point to the correct JDK (note using forward slashes for the path).
